### Task

Given an array, `A`, of `N` integers, print `A`'s elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, `N` (the size of our array).
The second line contains `N` space-separated integers describing array `A`'s elements.

### Constraints

* `1 <= N <= 1000`
* `1 <= A[i] <= 10000`, where `A[i]` is the `i`th integer in the array.

### Output Format

Print the elements of array  in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

### Sample Input

```
4
1 4 3 2
```

### Sample Output

```
2 3 4 1
