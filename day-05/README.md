# Day 5: Loops

### Objective

In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.
Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-loops/tutorial)
tab to learn more.

### Task

Given an integer, _n_, print its first 10 multiples.
Each multiple _n x i_ where 1 ≤ i ≤ 10 should be printed on a new line
in the form: `n x i = result`.

### Input Format

A single integer, _n_.

### Constraints

* 2 ≤ _n_ ≤ 20

### Output Format

Print 10 lines of output;
each line _i_ where 1 ≤ i ≤ 10 contains the _result_ of _n_ x _i_ in the form:
`n x i = result`.

### Sample Input
```
2
```
### Sample Output
```
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
```
